Allows 2 incompatible interfaces to work together.

Used when client expects a single interface, but the given interface is incompatible with the client's interface.

The adapter wraps the existing interface with a new interface that the client can use.

We don't need to change the existing interface, we just need to create a new adapter interface that the client can use.
